This program is able to triangulate a position based on two coordinates and the direction of the position to be calculated
It was initially designed to make it easier to find a stronghold in Minecraft, by using the player coordinates and the direction of two ender eyes, however, it can be applied for other purposes
I also used this as an opportunity to learn how to create custom images through code. The program automatically generates a diagram of the triangulated position relative to the other two coordinates and the center of the 2D space (0, 0)
